I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis.
I'm working with [Professor Jason Lowe-Power](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/jason-lowe-power) on vector-based acceleration via hardware/software co-design.

I received my Bachelor's degree from UC Davis, where I worked for over 5 years as a gem5 software engineer.

During my PhD, I interned for 9 months at AMD Research, where I was responsible for developing the software stack and the gem5-based simulation framework for a last-level cache prefetcher (the Pickle prefetcher).
I was also at Google for 3 months, where I built a pre-RTL area estimation model for the [XLS project](https://github.com/google/xls).

This summer, I'll be at Google Cloud as a software engineer intern.

## Research

My research work involves using the right tools for modeling hardware and writing software for new hardware, with a focus on designing programmer-friendly **vector architectures** and **accelerator designs**.

- **[Vector-based accelerators]** Studying vector-based accelerator designs.
- **[Prefetcher]** Designing Pickle prefetcher, a last-level cache prefetcher supporting irregular memory accesses in network-on-chip architectures.
- **[Tools]** Developing a gem5 framework for studying in-cache accelerators, modifying various parts of a hardware/software stack (e.g., kernel driver, compiler, ISA, cache coherence protocol) to support the accelerators.

## Previous Works

I worked at [Professor Ian Davidson](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/davidson/)'s lab in my undergraduate study, during which I co-authored [a SIGKDD paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=g6KC_pUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=g6KC_pUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).

## Previous Projects

- Enabling gem5 RISC-V full-system simulation with the newer RISC-V software stack.
- Working on gem5's out-of-order RISC-V Vector instructions execution.
- Implementing support for ARM load-link/store-conditional instructions for [FlexCPU](https://github.com/darchr/gem5/tree/flexcpu), an out-of-order CPU model.
- Implementing RV64IM in Chisel; utilizing [spike/riscv-isa-sim](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim) for verification.
- Designing a modular write-back multi-way cache system and memory interface in Chisel allowing having an arbitrary number of cache levels.
- Synthesizing the [DINOCPU](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu) designs using [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/).

## Teaching

I strongly believe that student engagement comes from understanding the nature of the problem, and from the [fluency](https://nautil.us/how-i-rewired-my-brain-to-become-fluent-in-math-235085/) of using tools (e.g. using software, using learned facts, and using learned abstractions) for problem solving.
