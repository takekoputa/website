I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis.
I'm working with [Professor Jason Lowe-Power](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/jason-lowe-power) on vector-based acceleration via hardware/software co-design.
I also work with [Professor Isaac Kim](https://hackmd.io/39K7_jYrS3K3k4Jbn66iHQ?view) on quantum architectures.

I received my Bachelor's degree from UC Davis, where I worked for 3+ years as a gem5 software engineer.

During my PhD, I interned for 9 months at AMD Research, where I was responsible for developing the software stack and modeling the performance of an experimental hardware component in gem5.
I was also at Google for 3 months, where I built a pre-RTL area estimation model for the [XLS project](https://github.com/google/xls).

## Research

My research work involves using the right tools for modeling hardware and writing software for new hardware, with a focus on designing programmer-friendly **vector architectures** and **accelerator designs**.

- **[Vector]** Studying vector-based accelerator designs.
- **[Accelerator]** Studying accelerator design for irregular memory accesses of HPC/graph-analytics/database applications on vector architectures.
- **[Tools]** Modifying various parts of a hardware/software stack (e.g., kernel driver, compiler, ISA, hardware simulator) to support new hardware organizations.
- **[Tools]** Enabling multiple-node full-system simulations via [gem5](https://www.gem5.org/)+[SST](https://sst-simulator.org/) integration.
- **[Miscs]** Exotic architectures.

## Previous Works

I worked at [Professor Ian Davidson](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/davidson/)'s lab in my undergraduate study, during which I co-authored [a SIGKDD paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=g6KC_pUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=g6KC_pUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).

- Designing a modular write-back multi-way cache system and memory interface in Chisel allowing having an arbitrary number of cache levels.
- Synthesizing the [DINOCPU](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu) designs using [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/).

## Teaching

I strongly believe that student engagement comes from understanding the nature of the problem, and from the [fluency](https://nautil.us/how-i-rewired-my-brain-to-become-fluent-in-math-235085/) of using tools (e.g. using software, using learned facts, and using learned abstractions) for problem solving.

I ocassionally solve problems at [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/) and [https://rosalind.info/](https://rosalind.info/).
I like solving problems with geometric interpretations.
