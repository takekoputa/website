I'm a fifth-year PhD student at UC Davis.
I'm working with [Professor Jason Lowe-Power](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/jason-lowe-power) on making the "should be flexible hardware" flexible, such as prefetchers.
We focus on the path of leveraging reconfigurable technologies situated near the last-level cache to build accelerators.

I worked on the gem5 project at UC Davis for 5 years, and I interned at Google and AMD during my PhD.

## Research

My research work involves using the right tools for modeling hardware and writing software for new hardware.

- **[Tools]** Developing the Choreographer platform, a gem5-based framework for studying in-cache accelerators. We model the full high-performance system with out-of-order CPU, a chiplet-based network on chip, a fully detailed cache coherence protocol, and the full software stack.
- **[Prefetcher]** Designing Pickle prefetcher, a last-level cache prefetcher accelerating irregular memory accesses in network-on-chip architectures.
- **[Vector-based accelerators]** Studying latency/throughput tradeoffs to build vector-based accelerators.

## Internships

- **[Google]**: I built a pre-RTL area estimation model for the [XLS project](https://github.com/google/xls) in the Summer 2024, and worked on the Borglet's CPU scheduling problem in the Summer 2025.
- **[AMD Research]**: I built the software/hardware stack for a last-level cache prefetcher (the Pickle prefetcher) in Summer 2023.

## Previous Works

I worked at [Professor Ian Davidson](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/davidson/)'s lab in my undergraduate study, during which I co-authored [a SIGKDD paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=g6KC_pUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=g6KC_pUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).

## Previous Projects

- Enabling gem5 RISC-V full-system simulation with the newer RISC-V software stack.
- Working on gem5's out-of-order RISC-V Vector instructions execution.
- Implementing support for ARM load-link/store-conditional instructions for [FlexCPU](https://github.com/darchr/gem5/tree/flexcpu), an out-of-order CPU model.
- Implementing RV64IM in Chisel; utilizing [spike/riscv-isa-sim](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim) for verification.
- Designing a modular write-back multi-way cache system and memory interface in Chisel allowing having an arbitrary number of cache levels.
- Synthesizing the [DINOCPU](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu) designs using [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/).

## Teaching

I strongly believe that student engagement comes from understanding the nature of the problem, and from the [fluency](https://nautil.us/how-i-rewired-my-brain-to-become-fluent-in-math-235085/) of using tools (e.g. using software, using learned facts, and using learned abstractions) for problem solving.

- Bootcamp Instructor, gem5 Bootcamp, UC Davis (Summer 2022).
- Teaching Assistant, Computer Architectures (ECS 154B/ECS 201A), UC Davis (Winter 2022 & 2023).
- Teaching Assistant, Optimization (MAT 168), UC Davis (Spring 2019).
- Teaching Assistant, Abstract Mathematics (MAT 108), UC Davis (Winter 2019).
