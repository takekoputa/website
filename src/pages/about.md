# Hi, I'm Hoa Nguyen.

I'm a friend of five cats.
The following is a diagram showing where I stand within the cat hierarchy.

By day, I make the computer's cache hierarchy less boring.
[Here’s a closer look at my research](./work/index.html).

I occasionally solve problems at [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/) and [https://rosalind.info/](https://rosalind.info/).
I like solving problems with geometric interpretations.
